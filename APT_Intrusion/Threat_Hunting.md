# Threat Hunting & Assessment

- Upon confirming that a system is suspect or compromised, our protocol begins by examining the network utilizing scalable tools for data collection and analysis.  
- We prioritize stacking occurrence and analyzing outliers.

## Malware Persistence Analysis

- The Kansa incident response framework was utilized on the network during live response.

- Autorunsc.exe is a tool that Kansa executes which is used to identify programs that start automatically at system boot or user logon.
